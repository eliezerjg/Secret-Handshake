LinkedList

Such a smart idea how it is the
implementation, you start as inserting head and then you literally push something at the end of the DS,
the things always go from the left to the right always at the end in the next insert.

There is a few tricks for delete, just connecting new edges storing the positions from the deleting points and connecting 
the wires
